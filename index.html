                        You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for
                        that work. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I
                        become
                        the Web Development Hero.

                    I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
